## Usage

To use CloudflareWarpSpeedTest, you can run the following command-line options:

```bash
CloudflareWarpSpeedTest -n 200 -t 10 -c 5000 -tl 300 -q -tll 0 -tlr 0.2 -p 10 -f ip.txt -ip 1.1.1.1 -o result.csv -all
```

Here is an explanation of the main available options:

  + `-n`        200: Specifies the number of latency test threads. Increasing this value can speed up the latency testing process, but it may not be suitable for lower-performance devices like routers. The default value is 200, with a maximum of 1000.
  + `-t`        10: Sets the number of times latency tests are performed for each IP address. The default value is 10 times.
  + `-c`        5000: The addressed number to be scanned. The default value is 5000.
  + `-ipv6`     IPv6 mode. Only scan ipv6 addresses. 
  + `-o`        result.csv: Sets the output result file. The default file is \"result.csv\".
  + `-all`      This flag indicates that all ip and port will be scanned.
  + `-pri`      Custom Wireguard private key.
  + `-pub`      Custom Wireguard public key. Default is the Warp public key.
  + `-reserved` Custom Reserved. Format: `[0, 0, 0]`
  
For more usage instructions, please use `-h`.
